 Performing interaction analysis for covid-19 data in the year 2022 for Texas state
 ## Motivation
Age can be a significant predictor of health outcomes, and unemployment can have an impact on an individual's economic well-being. I wanted to determine if unemployment and old age have an impact on people's well-being by analysing the connection between age and unemployment with the deaths per counties due to covid in the year 2022.As a native of India, I witnessed how unemployment during the covid shutdown led to the deaths of many people, and how age also had a large role in the deaths of people in India.
 I wanted to investigate how unemployment and age affected people in the United States, particularly in Texas, which has the most counties and is the second most populous state in the country.
 As a result, my first project focuses on how age and unemployment effect death due to covid in 2022 for all 254 counties in Texas.


## Summmary
I first started by assigning my measurement and factors from the data set which I got after cleaning and organizing my data from the raw data sets provided and my first linear analysis for mean deaths and unemployment have used my condition for unemployment to be greater than or equal to 3.8% as it is the average unemployment rate in the US and we see that more than half of the counties in Texas have been found to be having unemployment rate more than the average.After assigning and performing OLS regresssion we see the P-value to be 0.95 which is the slope value and intercept to be 0. by this we can say that unemployment has a very lesss influence over deaths in the counties due to covid-19 in the year 2022.
